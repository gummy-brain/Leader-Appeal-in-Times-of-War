# Leader Appeal in Times of War: Analysing Tweets about Putin and Zelensky with Natural Language Processing Tools

*Aurelija TylaitÄ—, 2022*

This research project was prepared while studying for a Master's degree in Contemporary Politics at Vilnius University. It served as my final project in the Political Psychology course.

**Research Goals:**

- Determine public perceptions conveyed in Twitter messages about V. Putin and V. Zelensky during the Russia-Ukraine war.

- Utilize the leader appeal models described by David G. Winter to understand what defines the appeal of Zelensky and Putin in the eyes of their followers.

- Assess whether the same leader appeal models can be applied to define the relationship between Putin and his followers and Zelensky and his followers.

**Research Objectives:**

- Summarize the theoretical models of leader appeal established by D. G. Winter.

- Use VADER's sentiment analysis to extract tweets that reflect positive assessments of Zelensky and Putin.

- Apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to messages detected during sentiment analysis to identify the main topics associated with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia by Twitter users who support them.

- Interpret the results of the LDA model by employing David G. Winter's theoretical models of leader appeal while also reviewing the tweets that best align with the themes identified by the model.

**Data:**

The primary source for this paper is a collection of tweets related to the Russia-Ukraine war, scraped by @BandWando, a member of the Kaggle.com community. The paper utilizes [@BandWando's dataset as of October 23](https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/4588898), consisting of 53,870,000 Twitter messages published since the start of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on February 24th.
